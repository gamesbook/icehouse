Pyramydal
=========

*An IceHouse game for 3+ players.  5 minutes per player.*

Background
==========

Every year, just before the dust storm season, collectors set forth across the sands of Mars.  They scavenge the assortment of Pyramydal cones that the Martians, from hundreds of centuries ago, used in their various activities.  They gather at the foot of Olympus Mons and assemble the pyramids into colorful and unique statues for the admiration and evaluation of the Art Collective.

Equipment
=========

* 4 IceHouse Stashes; plus one per player (if more than 4 players)
* 1 unique token per player (e.g. Monopoly tokens)

Objective
=========

The objective of the game is to form "statues" - stacks of pieces - that collectively have the greatest value.

Setup
=====

Toss all the IceHouse pieces (referred to here as "pyramids") into an opaque bag.  Mix them up, then draw them out one by one.   Place each one in a long line on the playing surface.  The pyramids can be placed upright or lying down; an eclectic mix is best! The line does not have to be straight; it can turn corners, or form a spiral, etc.  provided that the end and beginning are clearly known. 

Players then randomly place their tokens at the start of the line, such that they form part of it (extending "backwards").  The player whose token is closest to the start of the line is the first player.

Play
====

Movement
--------

In turn, each player must move their token as many "spaces" forward as they want along the line. A "space" is either another player's token or a pyramid.  Forward means away from the beginning and towards the end.

A player **cannot** end their move on another player's token but **must** end on a pyramid (up to, and including, the last one in line).  The only exception is if another player's token is already at the end of the line.  In this case, the moving player may land just **before** that last token and do nothing.

When a player's token lands on a pyramid, that pyramid is taken into the player's own Collection.

Any token that does not have any pyramids in the line in front of it may no longer move.  The owning player may still create statues (see below) from their Collection during their turn.

Statues
-------

As the game proceeds, players should use their pyramids to create "statues" - stacks of three pyramids in height.  Statue creation can only be done in a player's turn.  Once a statue is created (3 pyramids in a stack) it cannot be "undone".

A stack of three pyramids all of the same color **and** same type is worth:

* 12 for small sizes, 
* 24 for medium sizes, and 
* 36 for large sizes.

A stack of three pyramids each of a **different** colors and size is worth 18 points.  The exact same set of colors and sizes cannot be a duplicate of any existing statue. This stack should contain a large at the bottom, then a medium, with a small on top.

Game End
========

The game ends when only player has a token that can move.  That player may take one more turn, following which scoring takes place.

Scoring
=======

The player who first moved to the end of the line gets one "virtual" pyramid; an imaginary piece of any size or color (from the color range present) that can be used to form part of any statue that the player wants to create.

When the game ends, any pyramids in a player's Collection, that are not already part of statues, may now be used to create "mini" statues of two pyramids high.  The value of such statues is equal to their height (i.e. 2) multiplied by the sum of their values.  *For example, a statue with a big and small pyramid would be worth 8:  2 multiplied by 4 (i.e. 3 + 1).*

"Mini" statues do not have to be unique and may be composed of **any** two pyramids, regardless of color or size.

Any pyramids not part of a statue are worth 1 point each.

Winning
======

Players add up their scores; the winner is the one with the highest total.  In event of a tie, break this by total number of statues created and then, if still tied, by turn order, with preference in reverse.  For example, if the start player and third player have tied, the third player wins.

Alternate Rules
===============

Simultaneous Movement
---------------------

Players may want to try an interesting but more chaotic variant.  Each player gets an 6- (or 8- or 10-) sided die.  At the start of each round, each player simultaneously and in secret chooses a number on their die.  Reveal all the dice at once.  Starting with the player who is furtherest behind, each player moves their token as normal.  Other players' tokens count as "normal" pieces *except* if a player would end their move on another player's token - in this case they move to the next available pyramid.

Bonus Scoring
-------------

A player may get a bonus of 9 points for a "diagonal" - a set of pyramids each of the same color but a different size, that appears across three different statues.
