Ziggurat
========

*An IceHouse game for 2 players.  15 minutes.*

Equipment
=========

* 1 IceHouse stash per player.
* 1 6x6 square-gridded board (e.g. part of a chessboard)

Terminology
===========

A single IceHouse piece is referred to as a **Ziggurat** (or 'zig').  A stack of IceHouse pieces from large to small, with larger below, is referred to as a **Tower**.   A stack of IceHouse pieces from small to large, with smaller nested inside of larger, is referred to as a **Keep**.  The owning player for a stack is the one whose piece is the topmost on a stack.

There are three types of pieces: a Queen is the largest (3 points in value); a Drone is medium-sized (2 points); and a Worker is the smallest (1 point).

Setup
=====

Each player takes 3 sets of pieces, each of three sizes.  Each player then places a line of pieces across the row of the board closest to them: 2 Queens on the two outer squares of the row; 2 Workers on the two innermost squares of the row, and the 2 Drones on the remaining squares.  The used set is kept for reinforcements.

Objective
=========

The aim of the game is to be the first to exit a set of pieces - one each of a Queen, Drone and Worker - off the opponent's side of the board.

Play
====

Play alternates between the two players.  Players should randomly decide who starts.

A player, in their turn, must move one - and only one - piece that they own.  Once a player picks up a piece, that piece must be moved, unless there are no legal moves for that piece.

Movement
--------

* A Ziggurat moves forwards in a diagonal line (similar to a Bishop in Chess), up to a number of squares equal to its size.  A Ziggurat can move backwards to make a capture.
* A Tower moves like a Knight in Chess (one diagonal and one orthogonal, or vice-versa, in any direction) except that it cannot move over another piece.
* A Keep moves like a Rook in Chess - i.e. orthogonally in any direction - up to a number of spaces equal to its smallest value piece.

A player may **not** move individual pieces that form part of a Keep or Tower (unless it is to exit the top-most one - see below).

Captures
--------

Captures occur when a piece lands on another piece.  A piece can only land on another piece if a legal capture can be made. A player cannot capture their own pieces.

Captures can be "up" or "down".  In general, forming a Keep means capturing down, while forming a Tower means capturing up.

Captures to form a Keep, means that a larger Ziggurat lands on a piece one size smaller; or that a Ziggurat lands on a Keep whose top-most piece is one size smaller; or that a Tower lands on a piece which is one size smaller than the smallest piece already in that Tower.

Captures to form a Tower, means that a smaller Ziggurat lands on a piece one size larger; or that a Ziggurat lands on a Tower whose top-most piece is one size larger than the Ziggurat; or that a Tower lands on a piece which is one size larger than the largest piece already in that Tower.

Exits
-----

A player may, when they move a Ziggurat, exit it off the board, provided that the piece can be moved far enough to do so.  For this purpose, consider there to be an additional "invisible" row beyond the last on-board row onto which the piece is moving.

Only the top piece from a Tower or Keep can be exited; **only** if the Tower or Keep is already in the last row, and **only** by the owner of that piece.

A player may not exit more than one piece of each type; ie. if a Queen has already exited, the player may not exit another Queen.

Reinforcements
--------------

If a player's starting row has an empty square, they may place a new piece on that square from their reinforcements, provided that it matches the type of piece placed there at startup.  This counts as a move.


Game End
========

The game ends when one player finishes exiting a set of pieces - one each of a Queen, Drone and Worker - off the opponent's side of the board.  That player immediately wins.

The game also ends if one player has lost control of all pieces of a specific type i.e. the type has not been existed; and all pieces are in Towers or Keeps controlled by the opponent; and no piece remains in the reinforcements.  That player immediately loses.
